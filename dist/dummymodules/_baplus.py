"""A dummy stub module for the real _baplus.

The real _baplus is a compiled extension module and only available
in the live engine. This dummy-module allows Pylint/Mypy/etc. to
function reasonably well outside of that environment.

Make sure this file is never included in dirs seen by the engine!

In the future perhaps this can be a stub (.pyi) file, but we will need
to make sure that it works with all our tools (mypy, pylint, pycharm).

NOTE: This file was autogenerated by batools.dummymodule; do not edit by hand.
