    your timer around, use the :meth:`~babase.apptimer()` function instead

class ContextCall:
    """A context-preserving callable.

    This wraps a callable object along with a reference to the current
    context (see :class:`~babase.ContextRef`); it handles restoring the
    context when run and automatically clears itself if the context it
    belongs to dies.

    Generally you should not need to use this directly; all standard
    Ballistica callbacks involved with timers, materials, UI functions,
    etc. handle this under-the-hood so you don't have to worry about it.
    The only time it may be necessary is if you are implementing your
    own callbacks, such as a worker thread that does some action and then
    runs some engine code when done. By wrapping said callback in one of
    these, you can ensure that you will not inadvertently be keeping the
    current activity alive or running code in a torn-down (expired)
    :class:`~babase.ContextRef`.

    You can also use :class:`~babase.WeakCall` for similar functionality,
    but ContextCall has the added bonus that it will not run during
    :class:`~babase.ContextRef` shutdown, whereas
    :class:`~babase.WeakCall` simply looks at whether the target object
    instance still exists.

    **Example A:** Code like this can inadvertently prevent our activity
    (self) from ending until the operation completes, since the bound
    method we're passing (self.dosomething) contains a strong-reference
    to self)::

        start_some_long_action(callback_when_done=self.dosomething)

    **Example B:** In this case our activity (self) can still die
    properly; the callback will clear itself when the activity starts
    shutting down, becoming a harmless no-op and releasing the reference
    to our activity::

        start_long_action(
            callback_when_done=babase.ContextCall(self.mycallback))
    """

class ContextRef:
    """Store or use a Ballistica context.

    Many operations such as :meth:`bascenev1.newnode()` or
    :meth:`bascenev1.gettexture()` operate implicitly on a current
    'context'. A context is some sort of state that functionality can
    implicitly use. Context determines, for example, which scene new nodes
    or textures get added to without having to specify that explicitly in
    the newnode()/gettexture() call. Contexts can also affect object
    lifecycles; for example a :class:`~babase.ContextCall` will instantly
    become a no-op and release any references it is holding when the context it belongs to is destroyed.

    In general, if you are a modder, you should not need to worry about
    contexts; mod code should mostly be getting run in the correct
    context and timers and other callbacks will take care of saving
    and restoring contexts automatically. There may be rare cases,
    however, where you need to deal directly with contexts, and that is
    where this class comes in.

    Creating a context-ref will capture a reference to the current
    context. Other modules may provide ways to access their contexts; for
    example a :class:`bascenev1.Activity` instance has a
    :attr:`~bascenev1.Activity.context` attribute. You can also use
    the :meth:`~babase.ContextRef.empty()` classmethod to create a
    reference to *no* context. Some code such as UI calls may expect
    to be run with no context set and may complain if you try to use
    them within a context.

    Usage
    =====

    Context-refs are generally used with the Python ``with`` statement, which
    sets the context they point to as current on entry and resets it to
    the previous value on exit.

    Example: Explicitly clear context while working with UI code from
    gameplay (UI stuff may complain if called within a context)::

        import bauiv1 as bui

        def _callback_called_from_gameplay():

            # We are probably called with a game context as current, but
            # this makes UI stuff unhappy. So we clear the context while
            # doing our thing.
            with bui.ContextRef.empty():
